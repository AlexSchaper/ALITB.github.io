            <h2>Alex Schaper</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I’m 22 and work at a go karting centre, I enjoy playing a variety of games and I am a big fan of D&D. I finished year 12 in 2016, originally my idea was to study in either philosophy or become a counsellor, however over time I realized how much I loved computers and  technology and seeing how it all advanced so quickly. I have small experience with HTML, CSS and Unity (A game engine) and I hope you expand my knowledge on general technology with this course, especially in the programming field.

            <h2>Daniel Kljucevic</h2>
            <p>I am 40 and have been a public servant for the past 16 years. Most of this time has been spent as the technical lead for an IT solution. More recently, my role has me working with representatives from internal business areas to develop their correspondence related business requirements. These business requirements are delivered into an IT solution. At home I am a husband and father. I have also been a gamer for the last 20 years, most of this playing EQ2. Otherwise I am into gym work (or walking when I am lazy) and reading.

            <h2>Bethany Heard</h2>
            <p>So, I’m a 19-year-old female who’s primarily lived in very rural and isolated areas my entire life, currently situated in a not-so-rural Geelong.  I graduated high school in 2018 and originally went to university to study a course in psychology with honors; however halfway through the year I had severely lost interest and dropped out. Now here I am doing IT! I also have an interest in learning AUSLAN for some reason. As for IT, I don't really have too much experience. I have dabbled in the occasional coding app where I’ve learnt a bit of html but that's kind of it. Very interested in learning more about all aspects :)

            <h2>Peter Lubulwa</h2>
            <p>I’m 37, mainly a music/ art person but wound up working in finance to pay the bills (sad face emoji). I got interested in IT mainly through learning how to make websites - I’m still very noob-y, but I wanted to learn how to code from scratch because there are so many unique things you can make if you know what’s under the hood, so to speak. I really like learning how things work though - it feels like you can kind of make anything if you know  few skills.
